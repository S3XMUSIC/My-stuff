# Precipitation Data Analysis and Forecasting

This repository contains a project focused on the analysis of precipitation data and forecasting weather conditions for several years ahead.  
The work was completed as part of the **Data-Engineering-Dataset** course.  
The project is written in **Python**.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to:
- Analyze historical precipitation data  
- Perform preprocessing and transformation of raw data  
- Visualize precipitation patterns  
- Build models for **forecasting weather conditions** over multiple years  

This project demonstrates fundamental data engineering and machine learning practices.
